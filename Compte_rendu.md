## I. Introduction

The goal for this first set of exercises is to familiarize yourself with the programming environment that
we will use. Particularly with Keras, the deep learning python API that enables to program neural networks
in a concise way.

We propose to create an environment with python version 3.5 in anaconda and install/update useful
packages : Jupyter notebook, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, Scipy, scikit-learn, Tensorflow.

## II. Exercise 0

Create a conda environment with python 3.5

## III. Exercise 1 : Building a neural network to classify texts (multi-layer perceptron (MLP))

### III.1 Phenomena of over-fitting and under-fitting

- https://keras.io/datasets/
- Explore the dataset and calculate some basic statistics. Try to recover at least one review with the
help of the dictionary mapping (based on this Tensorflow tutorial).
- Experiment with different network sizes : try to reduce or increase the network size, and observe the
effect on the performance (accuracy of the prediction) and the running time.
- Change the network parameters to demonstrate the effects of over-fitting. Example.

## IV. Exercise 2 : Recurrent Neural Network and IMDB classification

## V. Exercise 3 : Text classification on the Ohsumed dataset
