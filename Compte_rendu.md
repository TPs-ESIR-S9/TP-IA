## I. Introduction

The goal for this first set of exercises is to familiarize yourself with the programming environment that
we will use. Particularly with Keras, the deep learning python API that enables to program neural networks
in a concise way.

We propose to create an environment with python version 3.5 in anaconda and install/update useful
packages : Jupyter notebook, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, Scipy, scikit-learn, Tensorflow.

## II. Exercise 0

Create a conda environment with python 3.5

## III. Exercise 1 : Building a neural network to classify texts (multi-layer perceptron (MLP))

## IV. Exercise 2 : Recurrent Neural Network and IMDB classification

## V. Exercise 3 : Text classification on the Ohsumed dataset
